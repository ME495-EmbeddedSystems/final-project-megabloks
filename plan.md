High level Plan (High level Milstones):-

1. [] Play around with isolated parts of the
      project and figure out how the project can
      be accomplished                              - 5d     -21/11 to 25/11
2. [] Integrate isolated parts and have atleast
      a very simple and basic version of the 
      problem running                              - 3d    - 26/11 to 29/12
3. [] Refine and improve and adapt it to fit 
      the whole problem                            - 5d    - 30/12 to 4/12
4. [] Make it robust and thorough test the sytem   - 3d    - 5/12 to 7/12
5. [] Buffer                                       - 2d    - 7/12 to 8/12 
6. [] Finish Report                                - 3d    - 9/12 to 11/12


Task deliverables for Milestone-1 (21/11 to 25/11):-
1. [] Senthil - Get communication with camera up and 
      running and come up with a very clear comuter
      vision plan for the system. Explore all
      baxter camera apis avaible in baxters.       
2. [] Marcel -  Read up on force control, 
      find out topics in RoS for force controls, 
      check these on real baxter gripping and
      pushing blocks. The robot should be able to
      pick up and grip megablocks from hardcoded 
      locations by the end of this milestone      
3. [] Luxi -  Read up on trajectory generation, 
      Show the robot following a hardcoded 
      trajectory.                                           
4. [] Allie - Setup the simulation world in gazebo
      Check on collision properties and how it
      affects the grippers. Setup up small scripts
      automating redundant tasks 
5. [] All - Go through all of baxter turtorials
